## Using Placeholder Images

If you don't have images ready, you can use placeholder services:

- [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) - Free high-quality photos
- [Lorem Picsum](https://picsum.photos/) - Placeholder images
- [UI Faces](https://uifaces.co/) - Profile pictures

### Quick placeholder examples:
```bash
# Download a placeholder profile image (400x400)
curl -o profile.jpg https://picsum.photos/400/400

# Download placeholder project images (800x600)
curl -o project1.jpg https://picsum.photos/800/600?random=1
curl -o project2.jpg https://picsum.photos/800/600?random=2
curl -o project3.jpg https://picsum.photos/800/600?random=3
curl -o project4.jpg https://picsum.photos/800/600?random=4
```

## Optimizing Images

Before adding images, consider optimizing them:

- Use tools like [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) or [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/)
- Resize images to appropriate dimensions
- Convert to WebP format for better compression (optional)

**Note**: The portfolio will still work without images, but adding professional images will significantly enhance the visual appeal for recruiters!
